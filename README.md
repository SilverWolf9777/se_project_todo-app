# Simple Todo App

This project I focused on changing the validator to be a class as well as some other parts of the app.

## Functionality

The app focuses on making tasks and setting due dates. When tasks are completed they are able to be deleted.

## Technology

I used classes to update the validator and the todo box elements.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on GitHub Pages:
